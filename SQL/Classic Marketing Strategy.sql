		## Classic Marketting Strategy ##
		-- -------------------------------
🔢 Basic Profit Analysis:
Item		(CP)	(SP)	Profit	 Profit Margin (%)
-------------------------------------------------
Bike		$2000	$3000	$1000		50%
Helmet		$10		$18		$8			80%
T-Shirt		$4		$8		$4			100%

🚀 Recommended Marketing Strategy:
1. High-Margin Accessory Upsell (Focus: Helmet, T-Shirt)
Strategy: Position helmet and t-shirt as premium add-ons at a slight discount in bundles.
Tactics:
Bundle pricing: e.g., Bike + Helmet + T-Shirt = $3022 instead of $3026 – minor discount, but increases total revenue and average order value.
Upsell during checkout with messages like:
"Add a helmet for only $15 (save 17%) – protect your ride in style!"
Why: Accessories have much higher profit margins, and bundling increases attachment rate.

2. Anchor the Bike as Premium (High-Involvement Product)
Strategy: Market the bike based on its quality, features, and emotional appeal (e.g., adventure, health, freedom).
Tactics:
Highlight value over cost: “Built for long rides. Priced for smart riders.”
Use lifestyle content: videos of bikers, health benefits, travel.
Why: The bike drives the bulk of revenue, and strong positioning helps upsell accessories.

3. Cross-Sell and Loyalty
Strategy: Introduce a post-purchase funnel for gear and apparel.
Tactics:
After a bike purchase, offer 20% off on more accessories (e.g., gloves, water bottles, maintenance kits).
Loyalty points for apparel purchases (low cost, high margin).
Why: Encourages return visits, repeat purchases, and customer lifetime value.

4. Seasonal Promotions & Gift Bundles
Strategy: Use festive seasons, cycling events, and back-to-school periods.
Tactics:
“Back-to-Ride Bundle”: Bike + Helmet + T-shirt at $2999.
“Father’s Day Fitness Gift Pack”: T-shirt + Helmet at 25% off.
Why: Appeals to emotion, gifting, and discounts without major profit compromise.

5. Digital Targeting by Product Affinity
Strategy: Use digital ads to target:
Bike intenders with content-rich ads.
Accessory buyers with lookalike audiences and retargeting.
Why: Maximize conversion by matching ad spend to margin potential.
